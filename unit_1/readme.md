# Unit 1. Getting started with Node.js

    Lesson 3 introduces npm and discusses how to configure a new Node.js application. In this lesson, you build a Node.js module, and learn how packages and modules offer tools and support to your application.

    Lesson 4 introduces the idea of a web server running on Node.js as a way to launch a simple website. You learn how to set up the server and write code to get your website content viewable.

    Lesson 5 builds on lesson 2 by giving the app enough information to load web content based on different requests. In this lesson, you build your first application route—a system for connecting content to URLs in your application.

    Lesson 6 teaches you how to serve different HTML files from your web server rather than simple responses. This lesson adds support for application assets: CSS, JavaScript that runs on the user’s device, and image loading. Together, these concepts enable you to organize and structure your application to handle more requests to your website with less code clutter.

    Finally, lesson 7 shows you how to put everything together by building a complete multipage application. You start a new application from scratch; then you add three views, routes for the views and assets, and a public client folder.
