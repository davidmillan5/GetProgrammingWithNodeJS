# Installing and using express-generator

As you continue to evolve your **Express.js** application, you adhere to a specific file structure. You have many ways to construct your application, though, depending on its intended use. To jump-start your application in the Express.js framework, you can use a package called **express-generator**.

**express-generator** provides some boilerplate code for an application. This tool offers scaffolding (prebuilt folders, modules, and configurations) that might have taken you a few hours to build from scratch. To install this package, use the global flag with the npm install command. **Enter the following command in terminal: npm install express-generator -g**. For UNIX machines, you may need to prepend this command with sudo or run it as an administrator.

When this package is installed, you can create a new project by entering express and the project name in a new terminal window. If your project is called Generation Generator, for example, enter express generation_generator in terminal. The express keyword in this context uses express-generator in terminal to construct the application with some views and routes.

Although this tool is great for constructing applications quickly, I donâ€™t recommend using it while running the exercises in this book. You should use a slightly different application structure from the one provided by express-generator. For more information about this package, visit
